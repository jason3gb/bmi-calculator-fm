    <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
    <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances
      of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with
      reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
      physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.</p>

  <section class="bmi-limitations">
    <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
    <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups
      should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gender</strong>: The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age.
        Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</li>
      <li><strong>Age</strong>: In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
        body fat content.</li>
      <li><strong>Muscle</strong>: BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
        differentiate muscle from fat.</li>
      <li><strong>Pregnancy</strong>: Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
        healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child.</li>
      <li><strong>Race</strong>: Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower
        BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.</li>
